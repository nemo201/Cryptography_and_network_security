# Cryptography_and_network_security

## Cryptography
Cryptography is a process in which the data is converted into unintelligible text, transmitted,
then converted back into a comprehensible form so it can only be read and processed by whom
it's intended.  <br />
Cryptography is associated with the process of preparing protected and secure data for
communication.  <br />
There are three main types of cryptography  <br />
• Symmetric Key Cryptography  <br />
• Asymmetric Key Cryptography  <br />
• Cryptographic Protocols  <br />

## RSA algorithm
The RSA algorithm is the basis of a cryptosystem is a suite of cryptographic algorithms that
are used for specific security services or purposes which enables public key encryption and is
widely used to secure sensitive data, particularly when it is being sent over an insecure network
such as the internet. <br />

## Homomorphic Encryption
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables a user to perform meaningful computations on sen-
sitive data while ensuring the privacy of the data. HE ensures that performing operations
on encrypted data and decrypting the result is equivalent to performing analogous operations
without any encryption. <br />

## Designing Aadhaar based social credit system for India
### Aadhaar
Aadhaar number is a 12-digit random number issued by the UIDAI Authority to the residents of India after satisfying the verification process laid down by the Authority. Any individual, irrespective of age and gender, who is a resident of India, may voluntarily enrol to obtain
Aadhaar number. Person willing to enrol has to provide minimal demographic and biometric
information during the enrolment process which is totally free of cost. An individual needs
to enrol for Aadhaar only once and after de-duplication only one Aadhaar shall be generated,
as the uniqueness is achieved through the process of demographic and biometric de-duplication.
